treatment of <e1>crohn 's disease</e1> with fusidic acid : an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to <e2>cyclosporin</e2> .
because of the need for the development of new treatments for <e1>crohn 's disease</e1> , a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of <e2>fusidic acid</e2> treatment in chronic active , therapy-resistant patients .
the results of this pilot study suggest that <e1>fusidic acid</e1> may be of benefit in selected chronic active <e2>crohn 's disease</e2> patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective .
because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of <e1>fusidic acid</e1> at the cytokine level in <e2>inflammatory bowel disease</e2> , we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated .

twenty common <e1>migraine</e1> patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of <e2>nitroglycerin</e2> ( 10 patients ) or placebo ointment ( 10 patients ) in a double blind study .
early onset <e1>migraine</e1> attacks were induced by <e2>nitroglycerin</e2> in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group .
subsequently 20 <e1>migraine</e1> patients , who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal <e2>nitroglycerin</e2> , received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas .
thus the <e1>migraine-inducing</e1> effect of <e2>nitroglycerin</e2> seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain , suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis .

on the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the <e1>muscular rigidity</e1> produced by <e2>morphine</e2> in rats .
the development of tolerance to the <e1>muscular rigidity</e1> produced by <e2>morphine</e2> was studied in rats .
saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of <e1>morphine</e1> ( 20 mg/kg i.p. ) showed a pronounced <e2>rigidity</e2> recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram .
rats treated for 11 days with <e1>morphine</e1> and withdrawn for 36 - 40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance : about half of the animals showed a <e2>rigidity</e2> after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic ( a group ) .

in a further series of experiments , <e1>haloperidol</e1> ( 0.2 mg/kg i.p. ) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the <e2>rigidity</e2> without any dopaminergic interference .
<e1>haloperidol</e1> enhanced the <e2>rigidity</e2> in the a group .
the results suggest that <e1>rigidity</e1> , which is assumed to be due to an action of <e2>morphine</e2> in the striatum , can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum .

concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with <e1>warfarin</e1> produced massive focal <e2>calcification of the artery</e2> media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted-diet , growth-inhibited group .

although the explanation for the association between <e1>artery calcification</e1> and growth status can not be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum <e2>phosphate</e2> and susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to warfarin-induced artery calcification , ie , the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet , growth-inhibited young rats .

high doses of <e1>vitamin d</e1> are known to cause <e2>calcification of the artery</e2> media in as little as 3 to 4 days .
high doses of the <e1>vitamin k</e1> antagonist warfarin are also known to cause <e2>calcification of the artery</e2> media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week .

because <e1>warfarin</e1> treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin d , the synergy between warfarin and vitamin d is probably best explained by the hypothesis that warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix gla protein as a <e2>calcification</e2> inhibitor .

<e1>sirolimus-associated</e1> <e2>proteinuria</e2> and renal dysfunction .
<e1>sirolimus-associated</e1> proteinuria and <e2>renal dysfunction</e2> .
<e1>sirolimus</e1> represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft <e2>nephropathy</e2> .
because <e1>sirolimus</e1> does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors , it has been designated a ' <e2>non-nephrotoxic</e2> drug ' .
however , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , <e1>sirolimus</e1> is associated with <e2>proteinuria</e2> and acute renal dysfunction .
however , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , <e1>sirolimus</e1> is associated with proteinuria and <e2>acute renal dysfunction</e2> .
the mechanisms of <e1>sirolimus-associated</e1> <e2>proteinuria</e2> are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal .
the <e1>acute renal dysfunction</e1> associated with <e2>sirolimus</e2> ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes .
although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of <e1>sirolimus</e1> on the kidney , the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of <e2>proteinuria</e2> and renal function , use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed .

progressive <e1>myopathy</e1> with up-regulation of mhc-i associated with <e2>statin</e2> therapy .

<e1>statins</e1> can cause a necrotizing myopathy and <e2>hyperckaemia</e2> which is reversible on cessation of the drug .
what is less well known is a phenomenon whereby <e1>statins</e1> may induce a <e2>myopathy</e2> , which persists or may progress after stopping the drug .
these observations suggest that <e1>statins</e1> may initiate an immune-mediated <e2>myopathy</e2> that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy .
the mechanism of this <e1>myopathy</e1> is uncertain but may involve the induction by <e2>statins</e2> of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up-regulation of mhc-i expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres .

the results indicate that acute <e1>nicotine</e1> injection induces a pronounced <e2>hyperactivity</e2> in rats habituated to the test environment .
therefore , certain limitations for <e1>malaria</e1> prophylaxis and treatment with <e2>mefloquine</e2> are recommended .
reduction in injection <e1>pain</e1> using buffered <e2>lidocaine</e2> as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization .
previous reports have suggested that <e1>pain</e1> associated with the injection of <e2>lidocaine</e2> is related to the acidic ph of the solution .
to determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the ph of <e1>lidocaine</e1> into the physiologic range would reduce <e2>pain</e2> during injection , we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization .
twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of <e1>pain</e1> after receiving standard <e2>lidocaine</e2> in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area .

prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog ( <e1>octreotide</e1> ) on gallbladder function and <e2>gallstone</e2> formation in chinese acromegalic patients .
prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog ( <e1>octreotide</e1> ) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in chinese <e2>acromegalic</e2> patients .
this article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 chinese patients with active <e1>acromegaly</e1> treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog <e2>octreotide</e2> in dosages of 300 - 1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months .
after withdrawal of <e1>octreotide</e1> in 10 patients without <e2>gallstones</e2> , 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month .
our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge , <e1>gallstones</e1> , and cholecystitis during <e2>octreotide</e2> therapy in chinese acromegalic patients .

these effects suggest that the protection from <e1>hemolysis</e1> by <e2>tocopherols</e2> is related to a decreased tam incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided .

therefore , <e1>tam-induced</e1> <e2>hemolysis</e2> results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane .
these defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by <e1>tam</e1> , resulting in <e2>hemolytic anemia</e2> .

on the 13th day , antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception , <e1>pain-induced</e1> functional impairment model , and the <e2>charcoal</e2> meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit .
in independent groups , <e1>morphine</e1> inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4 % and 38+/-4 % after acute and chronic treatment , respectively , suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the <e2>constipating</e2> effects .
the combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by <e1>morphine</e1> regardless of the time of treatment , suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine-induced <e2>constipation</e2> .

mice in which the cx3cr1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cdna encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( egfp ) were treated with <e1>meth</e1> and examined for striatal <e2>neurotoxicity</e2> .
we conclude from these studies that cx3cr1 signaling does not modulate <e1>meth</e1> <e2>neurotoxicity</e2> or microglial activation .

although there was a discrepancy between the amount of ctni and ctnt after <e1>dox</e1> , probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mabs to various ctni and ctnt forms , it is likely that ctnt in rats after dox indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that ctnt should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced <e2>cardiotoxicity</e2> and possibly for cardioprotective experiments .

<e1>neurotoxicity</e1> of <e2>halogenated hydroxyquinolines</e2> : clinical analysis of cases reported outside japan .
an analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible <e1>neurotoxic</e1> reactions to <e2>halogenated hydroxyquinolines</e2> reported from outside japan .
in six of the probable cases the <e1>neurological disturbance</e1> consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of <e2>clioquinol</e2> over a short period .
in six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible <e1>encephalopathy</e1> usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of <e2>clioquinol</e2> over a short period .
this was most frequently found in children , many of whom had received <e1>clioquinol</e1> as treatment for <e2>acrodermatitis enteropathica</e2> .
<e1>epileptic seizures</e1> following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing <e2>tranexamic acid</e2> in rats .
however , <e1>tamca</e1> has been shown to cause <e2>epileptic seizures</e2> .
we wanted to study whether <e1>tamca</e1> retains its <e2>convulsive</e2> action if incorporated into a fs .
findings : fs containing <e1>tamca</e1> caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct <e2>convulsive</e2> behaviours .
the degree of these <e1>seizures</e1> increased with increasing concentration of <e2>tamca</e2> .
thus , fs containing 47.5 mg/ml <e1>tamca</e1> evoked <e2>generalized seizures</e2> in all tested rats ( n=6 ) while the lowest concentration of tamca ( 0.5 mg/ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats .

thirteen patients with <e1>acute leukemia</e1> were treated with a <e2>dnr-containing</e2> regimen .
on the other hand , bnp did not increase in the patients without <e1>heart failure</e1> given <e2>dnr</e2> , even at more than 700 mg/m(2 ) .
these preliminary results suggest that bnp may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of <e1>anthracycline-induced</e1> <e2>cardiotoxicity</e2> .

conclusions : low prevalences and effects of low <e1>testosterone</e1> and high prolactin in <e2>erectile dysfunction</e2> can not justify their routine determination .
we now advocate that before age 50 years <e1>testosterone</e1> be determined only in cases of <e2>low sexual desire</e2> and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years .
prolactin should be determined only in cases of <e1>low sexual desire</e1> , gynecomastia and/or <e2>testosterone</e2> less than 4 ng./ml .
prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire , <e1>gynecomastia</e1> and/or <e2>testosterone</e2> less than 4 ng./ml .
