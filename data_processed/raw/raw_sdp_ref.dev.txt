few cases of drug-induced <e1>hiccups</e1> have been reported related to <e2>macrolide</e2> antimicrobials .
using the naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible ( score 5 points ) , mostly because of the close temporal sequence , previous reports on this reaction with other <e1>macrolides</e1> and the absence of any alternative explanation for <e2>hiccups</e2> .
our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by <e1>azithromycin</e1> could be the pathogenesis of <e2>hiccups</e2> in our patient .
however , <e1>macrolide</e1> antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with <e2>hiccups</e2> and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect .

thus , myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential <e1>hypertension</e1> and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a <e2>potassium-conserving</e2> diuretic ( amiloride ) and a similar period on a potassium-losing diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) in a randomised study .

compared to <e1>amiloride</e1> treatment , the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of <e2>ventricular ectopic beats</e2> ( 24-hour holter monitoring ) and a higher lown grading , increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential , prolonged ventricular effective refractory period , and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation .

the above results indicate that because <e1>potassium-losing</e1> diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with <e2>ischaemic heart disease</e2> , even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients .

swallowing-induced <e1>atrial tachyarrhythmia</e1> triggered by <e2>salbutamol</e2> : case report and review of the literature .
the <e1>arrhythmia</e1> resolved after therapy with <e2>atenolol</e2> , but recurred a year later .
after stopping the beta-agonist , and after a week with the <e1>atenolol</e1> , the <e2>arrhythmia</e2> disappeared .
conclusion : <e1>salbutamol</e1> is presented here as a possible trigger for <e2>siat</e2> .
although it is difficult to define causality in a case report , it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like <e1>salbutamol</e1> ( known to induce <e2>tachycardia</e2> ) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol ( that blocks the adrenergic activity ) may relieve it .

however , the mechanisms of <e1>myocardial ischemia</e1> induced by <e2>epinephrine</e2> were significantly different from those of exercise .
exercise-induced <e1>myocardial ischemia</e1> was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume , while <e2>epinephrine-induced</e2> ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product .

in order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on <e1>amphetamine-induced</e1> <e2>rotational behavior</e2> .
a substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when <e1>amphetamine</e1> was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the <e2>contralateral rotation</e2> .
however , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , <e1>amphetamine</e1> dose , or post-lesion motor exercise ) , amphetamine-induced <e2>rotation</e2> tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections .

dual effects of <e1>melatonin</e1> on barbiturate-induced <e2>narcosis</e2> in rats .
dual effects of melatonin on <e1>barbiturate-induced</e1> <e2>narcosis</e2> in rats .
<e1>melatonin</e1> affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle , but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced <e2>narcosis</e2> .
<e1>melatonin</e1> pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate <e2>narcosis</e2> , however , no dose-effect correlation was found .
melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner <e1>barbiturate</e1> <e2>narcosis</e2> , however , no dose-effect correlation was found .
in particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of <e1>barbiturate</e1> <e2>narcosis</e2> .
in contrast , the highest dose of <e1>melatonin</e1> ( 50 mg/kg ) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of <e2>narcosis</e2> , and a reduction in mortality rate .
<e1>melatonin</e1> 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced <e2>narcosis</e2> .
melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of <e1>ketamine-</e1> or diazepam-induced <e2>narcosis</e2> .
melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or <e1>diazepam-induced</e1> <e2>narcosis</e2> .
thus , the dual action of <e1>melatonin</e1> on pharmacological <e2>narcosis</e2> seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action .

<e1>dox</e1> control mice showed <e2>cardiac dysfunction</e2> measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo .
in <e1>dox</e1> b1r(-/- ) mice , <e2>cardiac dysfunction</e2> was improved compared to dox control mice , which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6 , as well as akt activation state .

these findings suggest that b1r is detrimental in <e1>dox</e1> <e2>cardiomyopathy</e2> in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis .
these insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing b1r antagonists for treatment of human <e1>dox</e1> <e2>cardiomyopathy</e2> .

hepatotoxicity associated with <e1>sulfasalazine</e1> in inflammatory <e2>arthritis</e2> : a case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events .
patients ' , who had <e1>hepatotoxicity</e1> on <e2>sulfasalazine</e2> and met a definition of a serious adr , were identified .
the likely frequency of <e1>hepatotoxicity</e1> with <e2>sulfasalazine</e2> was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions .
the likely frequency of serious <e1>hepatotoxicity</e1> with <e2>sulfasalazine</e2> was estimated at 0.4 % of treated patients .
conclusion : serious <e1>hepatotoxicity</e1> associated with <e2>sulfasalazine</e2> appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important .

the study involved 129 patients with <e1>diabetes</e1> with serum <e2>creatinine</e2> concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography .
conclusions : <e1>nephropathy</e1> induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when <e2>iodixanol</e2> is used rather than a low-osmolar , nonionic contrast medium .
experimental cranial <e1>pain</e1> elicited by <e2>capsaicin</e2> : a pet study .

<e1>neuroleptic malignant syndrome</e1> with <e2>risperidone</e2> .
<e1>neuroleptic malignant syndrome</e1> is thought to be a result of <e2>dopamine</e2> d2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia .
the high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of <e1>extrapyramidal symptoms</e1> with <e2>risperidone</e2> at low dosages .
a 73-year-old woman developed <e1>neuroleptic malignant syndrome</e1> after monotherapy with <e2>risperidone</e2> .
it appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with <e1>risperidone</e1> does not ensure protection from <e2>neuroleptic malignant syndrome</e2> .

plasma concentration and urine excretion of the <e1>renin-angiotensin</e1> system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome ( <e2>ns</e2> ) .
<e1>ns</e1> was induced by a single injection of <e2>puromycin amino-nucleoside</e2> ( pan ) .
<e1>ns</e1> was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino-nucleoside ( <e2>pan</e2> ) .
although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of ao were observed on day 6 after <e1>pan</e1> injection , when <e2>ns</e2> was clearly established , hepatic ao mrna levels did not change .
these data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic ao mrna levels are unaltered during the development of the acute <e1>ns</e1> induced by <e2>pan</e2> .
<e1>cyclophosphamide</e1> associated <e2>bladder cancer</e2> -- a highly aggressive disease : analysis of 12 cases .
purpose : we gained knowledge of the etiology , treatment and prevention of <e1>cyclophosphamide</e1> associated <e2>urothelial cancer</e2> .
materials and methods : the medical records of 6 men and 6 women ( mean age 55 years ) with <e1>cyclophosphamide</e1> associated <e2>bladder cancer</e2> were reviewed .
conclusions : <e1>cyclophosphamide</e1> associated <e2>bladder tumor</e2> is an aggressive disease .

acute blood pressure elevations with <e1>caffeine</e1> in men with borderline systemic <e2>hypertension</e2> .
whether the vasoconstrictive actions of <e1>caffeine</e1> are enhanced in <e2>hypertensive</e2> persons has not been demonstrated .
consequently , whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline , 33 % of borderline subjects achieved <e1>hypertensive</e1> bp levels after <e2>caffeine</e2> ingestion .
thus , in borderline <e1>hypertensive</e1> men , exaggerated responses to <e2>caffeine</e2> were : selective for diastolic bp , consistent with greater vasoconstriction , replicated in 2 protocols , and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives .

<e1>hallucinations</e1> and <e2>ifosfamide-induced</e2> neurotoxicity .
hallucinations and <e1>ifosfamide-induced</e1> <e2>neurotoxicity</e2> .
background : <e1>hallucinations</e1> as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of <e2>ifosfamide</e2> .
background : hallucinations as a symptom of central <e1>neurotoxicity</e1> are a known but poorly described side effect of <e2>ifosfamide</e2> .
most cases of <e1>ifosfamide-induced</e1> <e2>hallucinations</e2> have been reported with other mental status changes .
methods : the authors interviewed six persons with <e1>ifosfamide-induced</e1> <e2>hallucinations</e2> in the presence of a clear sensorium .
the clinician should be alerted for possible <e1>ifosfamide-induced</e1> <e2>hallucinations</e2> , which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity .

factors associated with <e1>nephrotoxicity</e1> and clinical outcome in patients receiving <e2>amikacin</e2> .
data from 60 patients treated with <e1>amikacin</e1> were analyzed for factors associated with <e2>nephrotoxicity</e2> .
group ii also showed a significant decrease of chronic <e1>nephrotoxicity</e1> secondary to long-term therapy with <e2>cyclosporine</e2> .
we think that even these lower dosages of <e1>cyclosporine</e1> can cause chronic <e2>nephrotoxicity</e2> and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect .

renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged <e1>isoflurane-induced</e1> <e2>hypotension</e2> in humans .
the effect of <e1>isoflurane-induced</e1> <e2>hypotension</e2> on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects .
<e1>hypotension</e1> was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the <e2>isoflurane</e2> inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmhg .
we conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during <e1>isoflurane-induced</e1> <e2>hypotension</e2> and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed .

prenatal exposure to <e1>fluoxetine</e1> induces <e2>fetal pulmonary hypertension</e2> in the rat .
epidemiological data suggest that <e1>fluoxetine</e1> exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent <e2>pulmonary hypertension syndrome</e2> of the newborn .
the mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical , considering the current evidence of a <e1>pulmonary hypertension</e1> protective <e2>fluoxetine</e2> effect in adult rodents .
as compared with controls , <e1>fluoxetine</e1> exposure resulted in <e2>fetal pulmonary hypertension</e2> as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum ( p = 0.02 ) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness ( p < 0.01 ) .
conclusions : in contrast to the adult , <e1>fluoxetine</e1> exposure in utero induces <e2>pulmonary hypertension</e2> in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation .

protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist , <e1>bn 52021</e1> , on bupivacaine-induced <e2>cardiovascular impairments</e2> in rats .
protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist , bn 52021 , on <e1>bupivacaine-induced</e1> <e2>cardiovascular impairments</e2> in rats .
administration of the local anaesthetic <e1>bupivacaine</e1> ( 1.5 or 2 mg/kg , i.v. ) to rats elicited a marked <e2>decrease of mean arterial blood pressure ( mbp ) and heart rate ( hr )</e2> leading to death ( in 67 % or 90 % of animals respectively ) .
intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor ( paf ) antagonist <e1>bn 52021</e1> ( 10 mg/kg ) , 30 min before bupivacaine administration ( 2 mg/kg i.v. ) suppressed both the <e2>decrease of mbp and hr</e2> .
intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor ( paf ) antagonist bn 52021 ( 10 mg/kg ) , 30 min before <e1>bupivacaine</e1> administration ( 2 mg/kg i.v. ) suppressed both the <e2>decrease of mbp and hr</e2> .
when <e1>bn 52021</e1> ( 20 mg/kg i.v. ) was injected immediately after bupivacaine ( 2 mg/kg ) , a partial reversion of the <e2>decrease of mbp and hr</e2> was observed , whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective .
when bn 52021 ( 20 mg/kg i.v. ) was injected immediately after <e1>bupivacaine</e1> ( 2 mg/kg ) , a partial reversion of the <e2>decrease of mbp and hr</e2> was observed , whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective .
since the administration of <e1>bn 52021</e1> , at all doses studied , did not alter mbp and hr at the doses used , the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of bn 52021 , a specific antagonist of paf , against bupivacaine-induced <e2>cardiovascular toxicity</e2> .

thus , consistent with its direct effect on heart , paf appears to be implicated in <e1>bupivacaine-induced</e1> <e2>cardiovascular alterations</e2> .

<e1>apomorphine</e1> : an underutilized therapy for <e2>parkinson 's disease</e2> .
<e1>apomorphine</e1> was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of <e2>parkinson 's disease</e2> .
while powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951 , the potential of treating fluctuating <e1>parkinson 's disease</e1> by subcutaneous administration of <e2>apomorphine</e2> has only recently become the subject of systematic study .
in addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous <e1>apomorphine</e1> infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa-induced <e2>dyskinesias</e2> .
in addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting <e1>levodopa-induced</e1> <e2>dyskinesias</e2> .
the main side effects of subcutaneous <e1>apomorphine</e1> treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems , whereas sedation and <e2>psychiatric</e2> complications play a lesser role .
given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous <e1>apomorphine</e1> treatment in fluctuating <e2>parkinson 's disease</e2> , this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use .
