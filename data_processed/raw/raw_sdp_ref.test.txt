methamphetamine ( meth ) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and <e1>meth</e1> abuse leads to negative emotional states including <e2>depressive symptoms</e2> during drug withdrawal .
however , it is currently unknown if the acute toxic dosage of <e1>meth</e1> also causes a long-lasting <e2>depressive</e2> phenotype and persistent monoaminergic deficits .
thus , we now assessed the <e1>depressive-like</e1> behaviour in mice at early and long-term periods following a single high <e2>meth</e2> dose ( 30 mg/kg , i.p. ) .
this <e1>depressive-like</e1> profile induced by <e2>meth</e2> was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission , indicated by a reduction in the levels of dopamine , dopac and hva , tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin , observed at both 3 and 49 days post-administration .

<e1>cancer</e1> incidence and <e2>metolachlor</e2> use in the agricultural health study : an update .
unassigned : <e1>metolachlor</e1> , a widely used herbicide , is classified as a group c carcinogen by the u.s. environmental protection agency based on increased <e2>liver neoplasms</e2> in female rats .
we evaluated <e1>cancer</e1> incidence through 2010/2011 ( nc/ia ) for 49,616 applicators , 53 % of whom reported ever using <e2>metolachlor</e2> .
we used poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of <e1>metolachlor</e1> use ( lifetime days , intensity-weighted lifetime days ) and <e2>cancer</e2> incidence .
we saw no association between <e1>metolachlor</e1> use and incidence of all <e2>cancers</e2> combined ( n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag ) or most site-specific cancers .
we saw no association between <e1>metolachlor</e1> use and incidence of all cancers combined ( n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag ) or most site-specific <e2>cancers</e2> .

nineteen patients ( 48.7 % ) substantially improved after the 8-week trial ; 5 ( 12.8 % ) discontinued therapy due to side-effects such as intolerable <e1>capsaicin-induced</e1> burning sensations ( 4 ) or <e2>mastitis</e2> ( 1 ) ; 15 ( 38.5 % ) reported no benefit .
if confirmed in controlled trials , the long-term results of this open , non-randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of <e1>capsaicin</e1> in <e2>phn</e2> is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes ( perhaps degeneration ) of nociceptive afferents .

studies of risk factors for <e1>aminoglycoside</e1> <e2>nephrotoxicity</e2> .
the epidemiology of <e1>aminoglycoside-induced</e1> <e2>nephrotoxicity</e2> is not fully understood .

clinical trials of <e1>aminoglycosides</e1> in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing <e2>acute renal failure</e2> during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70 % to 80 % .

since mesangial cc clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic <e1>pan</e1> treatment , we conclude that this preferential cc localization within the lesions is caused by an increased cc uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where <e2>sclerosis</e2> will develop subsequently .
similar to the remnant kidney model in <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephrosis</e2> the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to " mesangial overloading . "

therefore , we examined whether recombinant human ( rh ) igf-i is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> .
the <e1>glomerulopathy</e1> was induced by seven serial injections of <e2>pan</e2> over 12 wk .
urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhigf-i treatment in rats with chronic <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> .
after 12 wk , the inulin clearance was higher in rhigf-i-treated rats , 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 ml/min/100 g of body weight in untreated <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> animals , p < 0.05 .

in rats with <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> , administration of rhigf-i increased igf-i and gh receptor gene expression , without altering the steady state level of igf-i receptor mrna .
in normal rats with intact kidneys , rhigf-i administration ( n = 4 ) did not alter weight gain , blood pressure , <e1>proteinuria</e1> , gfr , glomerular planar area , renal cortical <e2>malondialdehyde</e2> content , or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage , compared with untreated animals ( n = 4 ) .

background : in dogs , a large amount of intravenous <e1>cocaine</e1> causes a profound <e2>deterioration of left ventricular ( lv ) systolic function</e2> and an increase in lv end-diastolic pressure .
methods and results : in 20 patients ( 14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years ) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of <e1>chest pain</e1> , we measured heart rate , systemic arterial pressure , lv pressure and its first derivative ( dp/dt ) , and lv volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of saline ( n=10 , control subjects ) or <e2>cocaine hydrochloride</e2> 1 mg/min ( n=10 ) .
conclusions : in humans , the intracoronary infusion of <e1>cocaine</e1> sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a <e2>deterioration of lv systolic and diastolic performance</e2> .

we report on rosaceiform <e1>dermatitis</e1> as a complication of treatment with <e2>tacrolimus</e2> ointment .
observations : six adult patients with <e1>inflammatory facial dermatoses</e1> were treated with <e2>tacrolimus</e2> ointment because of the ineffectiveness of standard treatments .

we visualize , for the first time , the profile of <e1>structural deficits in the human brain</e1> associated with chronic <e2>methamphetamine</e2> ( ma ) abuse .
we visualize , for the first time , the profile of <e1>structural deficits in the human brain</e1> associated with chronic methamphetamine ( <e2>ma</e2> ) abuse .
studies of human subjects who have used <e1>ma</e1> chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral <e2>metabolic abnormalities</e2> .
using magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and new computational brain-mapping techniques , we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic <e1>ma</e1> abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to <e2>cognitive impairment</e2> .
we used high-resolution mri and surface-based computational image analyses to map regional <e1>abnormalities in the cortex , hippocampus , white matter , and ventricles</e1> in 22 human subjects who used <e2>ma</e2> and 21 age-matched , healthy controls .
on average , <e1>ma</e1> abusers had 7.8 % smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects ( p < 0.01 ; left , p = 0.01 ; right , p < 0.05 ) and significant white-matter <e2>hypertrophy</e2> ( 7.0 % ; p < 0.01 ) .
mri-based maps suggest that chronic <e1>methamphetamine</e1> abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to <e2>impaired memory performance</e2> .
these brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of <e1>ma</e1> abuse , providing therapeutic targets for drug-induced <e2>brain injury</e2> .
<e1>amiodarone</e1> , an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent , has been reported to cause <e2>hepatotoxicity</e2> in some patients .

amiodarone induced <e1>hepatomegaly</e1> , hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation , and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and <e2>glucose</e2> .
the absence of induction of these genes as well as <e1>hepatomegaly</e1> in pparalpha knockout [ pparalpha-/- ] mice indicated that the effects of <e2>amiodarone</e2> were dependent upon the presence of a functional pparalpha gene .
compared to wild-type mice , treatment of pparalpha-/- mice with <e1>amiodarone</e1> resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body <e2>weight loss</e2> .
the inability of <e1>amiodarone</e1> to directly activate either human or mouse pparalpha transiently expressed in human hepg2 <e2>hepatoma</e2> cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect .

the diagnosis of <e1>droperidol-induced</e1> <e2>psychological disturbance</e2> was not made straight away although on subsequent close questioning the patient gave a very clear history .
the nursing staff , by reviewing the patient 's health history with his family , discovered a history of <e1>polydipsia</e1> and long-standing <e2>lithium</e2> use .
<e1>lithium</e1> is implicated in drug-induced <e2>nephrogenic di</e2> , and because the patient had not received lithium since being admitted to the hospital , his treatment changed to focus on nephrogenic di .

drug-induced <e1>long qt syndrome</e1> in injection drug users receiving <e2>methadone</e2> : high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factors .
in the inpatient setting , the frequency of <e1>qt interval prolongation</e1> with <e2>methadone</e2> treatment , its dose dependence , and the importance of cofactors such as drug-drug interactions remain unknown .
in addition to <e1>methadone</e1> dose , 15 demographic , biological , and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for <e2>qt prolongation</e2> .
six patients ( 3.6 % ) in the <e1>methadone</e1> group presented <e2>torsades de pointes</e2> .

the study 's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential ( sap ) amplitude in patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( cle ) treated with thalidomide and use these findings to identify the <e1>neurotoxic</e1> potential of <e2>thalidomide</e2> and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment .
patients and methods : clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with <e1>cle</e1> during treatment with <e2>thalidomide</e2> and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed .
at detection of reduction in sural nerve sap amplitude , the median <e1>thalidomide</e1> cumulative dose was 21.4 g. the threshold <e2>neurotoxic</e2> dosage is lower than previously reported .
this electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical <e1>neurotoxic</e1> potential of <e2>thalidomide</e2> but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms .

reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease , in a patient who developed a <e1>lung mass</e1> ( 1.5 cm in diameter ) and proteinuria ( 2.76 g/day ) after treatment with <e2>amiodarone</e2> for a long time .

the <e1>lung mass</e1> was highly suspected to be lung cancer on ct and positron emission tomography , but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies , indicating that it was an <e2>amiodarone-related</e2> lesion .

the present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an <e1>amiodarone-related</e1> <e2>pulmonary lesion</e2> and a neoplasm can be very difficult radiologically , and suggests that membranous glomerulonephritis might be another possible complication of amiodarone treatment .

smoking of <e1>crack cocaine</e1> as a risk factor for <e2>hiv infection</e2> among people who use injection drugs .
background : little is known about the possible role that smoking <e1>crack cocaine</e1> has on the incidence of <e2>hiv infection</e2> .
given the increasing use of <e1>crack cocaine</e1> , we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for <e2>hiv infection</e2> .
to determine whether the risk of <e1>hiv seroconversion</e1> among daily smokers of <e2>crack cocaine</e2> changed over time , we used cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods : may 1 , 1996-nov .
after adjusting for potential confounders , we found that the risk of <e1>hiv seroconversion</e1> among participants who were daily smokers of <e2>crack cocaine</e2> increased over time ( period 1 : hazard ratio [ hr ] 1.03 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 0.57 - 1.85 ; period 2 : hr 1.68 , 95 % ci 1.01 - 2.80 ; and period 3 : hr 2.74 , 95 % ci 1.06 - 7.11 ) .
interpretation : smoking of <e1>crack cocaine</e1> was found to be an independent risk factor for <e2>hiv seroconversion</e2> among people who were injection drug users .

apart from this cytostatic effect , <e1>temsirolimus</e1> had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of <e2>tumor</e2> microvessel density and of vegf expression .
moreover , numerous patchy , well-limited fibrotic areas , compatible with <e1>post-necrotic</e1> tissue repair , were found after 6-month <e2>temsirolimus</e2> therapy .
thus , <e1>temsirolimus</e1> reduced <e2>tumor</e2> burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects .
